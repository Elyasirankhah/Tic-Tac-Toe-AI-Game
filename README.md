# Tic-Tac-Toe-AI-Game

This AI game is generally played by kids and is sometimes used as an introductory illustration for artificial intelligence or programming (AI). A computer program that simulates the opponent in a game of AI tic tac toe uses algorithms to make plays that test the player. The computer uses a variety of tactics to choose its next move, such as scanning the grid for patterns or estimating the chance of victory based on the game's present circumstances. The application can be made to have different levels of difficulty, increasing in difficulty as the player moves through the game. In general, playing an AI Tic Tac Toe game is a fun and interesting method to learn about programming and AI ideas.

Basically, the AI opponents have been introduced as three charactors as follows:
Olivia which is equal easy stage
Emma which is equal Meduim stage
Chris which is Advanced stage
